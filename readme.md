## Overview

These Jupyter Notebooks showcase how to perform statistical analysis using Jupyter, Python, and popular data science libraries. The `ttest.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to conduct a t-test for comparing two sample means, while the `regression.ipynb` notebook covers linear regression analysis.

## Installation

To run these Jupyter Notebooks, you'll need to have Jupyter installed on your system. If you haven't already installed it, follow these steps:

1. Install Python (if not already installed). You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install Jupyter using pip, a package installer for Python. Open your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

## Running the Notebooks
Once you have Jupyter installed, follow these steps to run the notebooks:  

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.  

Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the directory where you saved the notebooks.  

Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:  
```
jupyter notebook
```
Your web browser will open, displaying the Jupyter Notebook dashboard. Click on the notebook you want to open (ttest.ipynb or regression.ipynb) to start working with it.

## Notebook Descriptions
#### ttest.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates how to perform a t-test for comparing two sample means. It includes explanations of the t-test concept, assumptions, and step-by-step implementation using random generarated data from Python and libraries such as NumPy and SciPy. I alson demonstrate how to investigate a sample of data from patients, of different ages and sex, of their blood pressure before and after they had recieved treatment using the ttest.

#### regression.ipynb
In this notebook, you'll learn about linear regression analysis. It covers the basics of linear regression, how to fit a linear regression model to data, and how to interpret the results. Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn are used for this analysis.
